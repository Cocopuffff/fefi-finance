      "description": "The BOJ got the ball rolling in USD/JPY this week but so far we're seeing the drop stall at the first key hurdle. The pair shook off the 150.00 mark on Wednesday before a fall below 148.00 yesterday. But we are seeing a slight pause in the decline amid a test of the 100-day moving average (red line). That level is seen at 147.70 currently.With the US jobs report coming up, we're likely to see price action keep stuck around here in the meantime. As such, don't expect much fireworks in European trading later.At the balance, the bias is still for a move lower in the pair at the moment. That considering traders are now sensing a hawkish shift by the BOJ and also the stronger bids in the bond market this week. 10-year Treasury yields are down further to 4.08% now, some 27 bps off its highs just two weeks ago.The non-farm payrolls data will determine what comes next before the weekend. But at this stage, I'd be inclined to sell any pop higher in USD/JPY. That unless there are any major surprises in the data that would warrant a change in the Fed outlook - which I would label as unlikely. This article was written by Justin Low at www.forexlive.com.",

      "description": "There is a central-bank tilt in EURUSD and the USDJPY with the focus not on the Fed but on the ECB and the Bank of Japan. The EURUSD is moving lower after the ECB cut their inflation expectations going forward and ECB Pres. Lagarde talked about continued slower growth. However, she did also mentioned that they still needed to see more data and information before making a decision. The EURUSD retested it's broken 38.2% retracement of the move down from the December high on it's run lower. That level comes at 1.0864. Recall from yesterday, the price not only broke away from the 38.2% retracement level, but also tested its 50% midpoint at 1.09165 before finding willing sellers. The 50% is at 1.09165.The Bank of Japan gave its little hints on exiting negative interest rates and yield curve control (it will be slow but it could be a start). As a result, the USDJPY tumbled below its 200 bar moving errors on the 4-hour chart at 149.155 and extended down to and through its 100-day moving average at 147.813.While the EURUSD is moving lower, the GBPUSD is higher today and moves closer to the 1.2800 target (trades at 1.2753 currently). The high price reached 1.2762 apart today. This article was written by Greg Michalowski at www.forexlive.com.",

      "description": "As the North American session begins, the JPY is the strongest and the EUR and USD are the weakest (they are battling it out for the weakest crown). The focus day has been on the USDJPY and the JPY crosses as the anticipation for an exit from the yield curve controls and negative interest rate policy is heightened. BoJ Board Member Nakagawa highlighted the gradually increasing prospects of achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably, while noting that consumption remains weak in both nominal and real terms, which requires close attention. Nakagawa mentioned that waiting for wage negotiation outcomes from smaller firms could extend the timeline until autumn or beyond. The decision on policy shifts will be made after careful scrutiny of data and its duration of analysis. The discussion on ending negative interest rates will also involve deliberation on the fate of other unconventional monetary easing tools. Consumption trends will play a crucial role in determining the timing to end negative rates, with wage hikes and sustained wage gains expected to bolster consumption.Nakagawa emphasized that it's not essential to wait for the outcome of all wage negotiations among small and mid-sized firms to decide on ending negative rates. Ensuring a continuous rise in wages to sustain inflation around 2% is vital. There is no predetermined plan regarding the concurrent ending of Yield Curve Control (YCC) with an exit from negative rates. The decision to end negative rates will not solely depend on the outcomes of wage talks from the previous and current years. Meanwhile, BOJ governor Ueda said it is fully possible to seek an exit from stimulus while striving to achieve the desired 2% inflation target. He added that they would mull adjusting easing if they can achieve the price target and that the chance of reaching the target is gradually rising. He once again reiterated that the central bank would consider paring back the stimulus program once a positive cycle wages inflation is confirmed.PS Japan's largest trade union confederation Rengo said today that the average wage demands topped 5% for the first time since 1994In the UK, the BOE Monthly Decision Maker Panel one year ahead CPI inflation expectations declined to 3.3% in February from 3.4% in January. Meanwhile, the three-month average of the three-year inflation expectation fell to 2.8% versus 2.9% in January. The three-month moving average expected wage growth remained unchanged at 5.2%.The ECB rate decision will be released at 8:15 AM ET expectations for no change for the main refinancing rate at 4.5% as policymakers wait for inflation to give a clearer picture (Lagarde press conference at 8:45 AM ET). The April wage data outcomes is also a sticky point for policy decisions. The market is pricing in a June cut (92% chance), and three – four cuts by year-end.US initial jobless claims will be released at 8:30 AM with expectations of 215K unchanged from last week. Trade data in the US will also be released with expectations of a deficit of -63.5 billion versus a deficit of -62.2 billion last month. Revised productivity and unit labor costs for Q4 expected to show 3.1% for activity down from 3.2% in the preliminary report. Unit labor costs are expected to rise by 0.6% versus 0.5 previously reported.The key US employment data is approaching with it scheduled to be released at 8:30 AM ET on Friday. The expectation is for a gain of just under 200K non-farm payroll jobs versus a surprisingly stronger-than-expected 353K last month. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.7% with average hourly earnings tapering to 0.2% from 0.6% last month.US stocks are higher in premarket trading with yields marginally lower.

      "description": "That is the first stop on the way down as highlighted earlier here. The BOJ has gotten the ball rolling on the Japanese yen and we're now just seeing things set in motion.A break below the 100-day moving average (red line) at 147.73 will see buyers surrender the recent upside bias. That will then put into focus minor support from the 38.2 Fib retracement level at 146.82 next. But as mentioned earlier, the big one to watch will be the 1 February low near 146.00 and the 200-day moving average (blue line) - seen at 146.11 currently.As the yen continues to build momentum ahead of the BOJ policy meeting later this month, those will be key levels to watch moving forward. Considering the recent technical break lower in Treasury yields as well, it is rather compelling to keep arguing for a further drop in USD/JPY at this point.That being said, the upcoming US data releases might still alter the equation. We will first have the US non-farm payrolls release tomorrow. And next week, there will be the US CPI data, PPI data, and retail sales. Also on the agenda next week, there will be 10-year and 30-year Treasury auctions to watch out for. This article was written by Justin Low at www.forexlive.com.",

      "description": "USDThe Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected at the last meeting and dropped the tightening bias in the statement.The US PCE came in line with expectations.The US ADP and the US Job Openings missed expectations.The latest US ISM Manufacturing PMI missed expectations by a big margin remaining in contraction with the US ISM Services PMI following suit but holding on in expansion. The US Consumer Confidence missed expectations across the board.The market expects the first rate cut in June. JPYThe BoJ kept its monetary policy unchanged as expected at the last meeting with interest rates at -0.10% and the 10 year JGB yield target at 0% with 1% as a reference cap. The Japanese CPI beat expectations although all measures eased further from the prior readings. The latest Unemployment Rate remained unchanged hovering around cycle lows.The Japanese PMIs improved for both the Manufacturing and Services measures although the former remains in contractionary territory.The Japanese wage data beat expectations by a big margin.The Tokyo CPI, which is seen as a leading indicator for National CPI, recently came in line with expectations with the measures increasing from the prior report. The market expects the BoJ to hike rates in March.USDJPY Technical Analysis – Daily TimeframeOn the daily chart, we can see that USDJPY is rolling over as the market participants started to position for the BoJ to exit the negative interest rates policy (NIRP) probably at the upcoming meeting on the 19th of March. The massive Yen appreciation started with the miss in the US ISM Manufacturing PMI that depressed global yields and was followed by a miss in the ISM Services PMI and other US labour market data. On the Japanese front, the BoJ members started to deliver hawkish comments recently and we got reports of imminent changes at the upcoming policy meeting. The strong wage data today just added further fuel to the speculation and triggered further carry trades unwind. USDJPY Technical Analysis – 4 hour TimeframeOn the 4 hour chart, we can see that the sellers piled in aggressively on a break below the support zone around the 149.60 level and increased the bearish bets on the break below the 148.80 level. The target should now be the 146.60 level and it looks like there’s nothing now that can’t stop this train going as the buyers rush for the exits and the sellers sell any rally into the BoJ meeting. One risk could come from a hot NFP report tomorrow, but if the data comes out in line or even below expectations, then we could see another strong wave of selling coming into the market. USDJPY Technical Analysis – 1 hour TimeframeOn the 1 hour chart, we can see that if we were to get a pullback, a good resistance where the sellers can short from would be the resistance turned support around the 148.80 level where we can find the confluence with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, the trendline and the red 21 moving average. The buyers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking above the trendline to start getting back into the market and target the highs around the 150.90 level, although the chances at the moment are very low. Upcoming EventsToday we get the latest US Jobless Claims figures, while tomorrow we conclude the week with the US NFP report.
